Thank you for your interest in helping improve the security of Kubernetes.

The public Kubernetes website is a read-only resource that does not collect or process any personal information, and as such, we do not believe that clickjacking is a threat to the project or its users. If you believe you have discovered a particular instance in which clickjacking can be used to harm a user or the project, please supply additional details.

Thank you,

The Kubernetes Security Response Committee

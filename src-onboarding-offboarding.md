the Kubernetes SRC (Security Response Committee).

For the purpose of example, we will use a placeholder name of **Jane Doe** with
a github username **`jdoe`** and a company name of **ACME LTD**.

### Required file and access grant updates.

Once the SRC has promoted an individual(s)  to a full SRC member, various
systems require updating. Likewise, should a SRC member leave the SRC - the
reverse is required, with the user being removed from each system.

#### kubernetes/security repository

All SRC member discussion & approval must happen on the `kubernetes/security`
repository first and only once approved by means of the pull request being
merged, should pull requests be approved / merged in the `kubernetes/community`
repository, and the user added to the mailing lists and ACLs.

##### file: https://github.com/kubernetes/security/blob/master/README.md

Add / remove the SRC member(s) github name from `security/README.md`
to the appropriate list of committee members, according to the usernames
alphabetical placing.

```
The initial Security Response Committee will consist of volunteers subscribed to the private [Kubernetes Security](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/forum/#!forum/security) list. These are the people who have been involved in the initial discussion and volunteered:

- Jane Doe (**[@jdoe](https://github.com/jdoe)**) `<jdoe@acme.com>` [GPG_KEY]
```

If removing a SRC member, move them to the list of emeritus members.

##### file: https://github.com/kubernetes/security/blob/master/OWNERS_ALIASES

Add / remove the SRC member(s) github name from `security/OWNERS_ALIASES` to the
existing `security-response-committee` field, according to the usernames
alphabetical placing:

```yaml
aliases:
  security-response-committee:
    - jdoe
```

#### kubernetes/k8s.io repository

##### file: https://github.com/kubernetes/k8s.io/blob/main/groups/committee-security-response/groups.yaml

`groups.yaml` is the source of truth for membership to the
security-response-committee mailing lists. Update the `owners` field for the
following lists:

- `security@kubernetes.io`
- `security-discuss-private@kubernetes.io`
- `distributors-announce@kubernetes.io`

Ensure the 3 lists match.

##### file: https://github.com/kubernetes/k8s.io/blob/main/OWNERS_ALIASES

```yaml
aliases:
  security-response-committee:
    - jdoe
```

#### kubernetes/community repository

##### file: https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sigs.yaml

Add / remove the SRC member(s)  github name from `community/sigs.yaml` to the
existing `label`| `leadership` field, according to the usernames alphabetical
placing:

```yaml
label: security-response
  leadership:
    chairs:
    - github: jdoe
      name: Jane Doe
      company: Acme LTD
```

Once the yaml is updated, run `make generate` to regenerate the markdown
versions.

This will then automatically create the following files:

* kubernetes/community/OWNERS_ALIASES
* kubernetes/community/security-response-committee/README.md
* kubernetes/community/sig-list.md

##### file: https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/communication/slack-config/usergroups.yaml

Add / remove the SRC member(s) github name from the `security-response-committee` user group.

#### kubernetes/org repository

##### file: https://github.com/kubernetes/org/blob/master/config/kubernetes/org.yaml

Add / remove the SRC member(s) github username from `config/kubernetes/org.yaml`
to the existing `security-response-committee` | `members` field. The usernames
should be alphabetized:

```yaml
  security-response-committee:
    description: Please report security issues to https://kubernetes.io/security
    members:
    - alice
    - bob
    - jdoe
```

Once merged, [peribolos](https://git.k8s.io/test-infra/prow/cmd/peribolos) will
automatically run and update the members of the GitHub group
https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/teams/security-response-committee

####  Add/remove from HackerOne

To add or remove members from the Kubernetes HackerOne project, navigate to
https://hackerone.com/organizations/linux_foundation/settings/users

Click `Remove` next to a member to remove.

Click `Invite user` to add a new SRC member. Add them to the `Kubernetes Team`,
`Standard` and `Admin` groups.

We also request that new members enable 2-factor auth. Once they've accepted the
invitation, you can verify the status in the `2FA` column on the user management
page.

After verifying 2FA status, make the new member an "Organization Administrator"
by selecting "Edit user" from the context menu, then enabling "Organization
Administrator".

####  Add/remove from OpsGenie rotation

##### url: https://app.opsgenie.com/teams/dashboard/633ac733-665f-4d62-871e-cbc011f37037

Once the user account has been created in OpsGenie, they must add a
`github=GITHUB_USERNAME` tag to their OpsGenie profile for the tool to work.

See the below example.

##### url: https://kubernetes.app.opsgenie.com/settings/schedule/detail/f835cdef-8df9-4ddc-9a39-911cb9e521b5

Click `Edit Rotation` next to "PST Rotation", and add/remove the new member from the participants list.

####  Add/ Remove SRC Owner permission from Kubernetes Security Mailing Lists

New SRC members are added to various security lists and upgraded to "owner" (or
downgraded to member if they are leaving the SRC)

To add members and assign the "owner" role:

1. Visit the groups URL as a user authenticated as an existing "owner".
2. Select the 'Manage group' or 'Manage Members' link.
3. Within the left side panel, select 'Direct add member'.
4. Enter the new SRC members email address
5. Select the 'All members' link, or search for the new member in the search box.
6. Select the new member and change the drop down role to "Owner" (or "Manager" in the case of kubernetes-announce)

---

**Existing Accounts**

It may be the case, that the user has already joined the group / mailing list.
If this is the case, steps 1 to 4 can be ignored and you can proceed to change
the role of their existing account.

---

To downgrade existing owners to members:

1. Visit the groups URL as a user authenticated as an existing "owner".
2. Select the 'All members' link, or search for the existing owner in the search box.
3. Select the owner and change the drop down role to "Member".

| Mailing List        | URL                                                                  |
| -------------       | -------------                                                        |
| Security Discuss    | https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubernetes-security-discuss  |
| Security Announce   | https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubernetes-security-announce |
| Kubernetes Announce | https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubernetes-announce (Manager)|
| Kubernetes Dev      | https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubernetes-dev (Member)      |

_Note: the @kubernetes.io addresses are now managed through `groups.yaml`_

#### Discuss Account

A verified [discuss account](https://discuss.kubernetes.io/) is required.

#### kubernetes-security github org

Update the kubernetes-security github org team members for the additions or
removals.

Navigate to https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes-security/people, and invite new
members or remove existing members. Note that several non-SRC members have
access to this org (primarily release managers).

Once a new SRC member has accepted the invite, they should be granted `Owner`
permissions.

For members stepping down, please ensure they are not assigned any issues in
the vulnerability trackers:

- https://github.com/kubernetes-security/security-disclosures/issues
- https://github.com/kubernetes-security/security-disclosures-low/issues

#### Slack

SRC members must enable slack 2-factor authentication: https://slack.com/help/articles/204509068-Set-up-two-factor-authentication

New members must be manually added to the private channels on slack by someone
who is already a member of those channels:

1. `#SRC-private` for private SRC-only discussion
2. `#security-release-team` for private discussions with the security-release-team

Members who are stepping down must leave the channels themselves. 

Finally, ask a `#slack-admins` member to add the new SRC member to the list of people who can post in `#announcements`. 

If a member is stepping down, we must let the admins know to remove the `#announcements` permission. 

#### Calendar

Update the Google calendar entries to add or remove the member:

1. SRC Monthly (monthly, first Thursday)
2. HackerOne sync (every 3 months, second Thursday)

#### Google Docs

Update the sharing settings for the following docs:

- "SRC Monthly Agenda & Notes" (owner: timallclair@gmail.com)
- "Kubernetes CNA Tracker" (owner: timallclair@gmail.com) - Only for [CNA trained members](https://github.com/kubernetes/security/blob/master/cna-handbook.md)

SUBJECT: `Kubernetes Disclosure List Removal Due to Uncertified Status`

---

Hello $MEMBER-

The [Kubernetes Product Security Committee][psc] has removed $EMAIL from the distributors-announce@kubernetes.io Google Group.

This is because $PRODUCT is no longer a [certified Kubernetes Distribution][conformance], a requirement for membership to this list.

If $PRODUCT recertifies, and meets all other criteria, please submit a [request to re-join using the normal process][join-process].

Thank You,

$PERSON on behalf of the Kubernetes Product Security Committee
